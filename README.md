# lifecycle-integration-patterns
The Lifecycle Integration Patterns Working Group

See the Lifecycle Integration Patterns Wiki at: https://github.com/OSLC/lifecycle-integration-patterns/wiki

This group will collect and descibe typical and useful patterns how to apply OLSC for Lifecycle collaboration.
The goal is to build a comprehensive libray of pattern over time.

All users of OSLC are invited to propose and contribute additional patterns
...

First ideas and things to do before we launch the WG:
- decide about the name (lifecycle-integration-patterns or lifecycle-collaboration-patterns other?)
- do we need a process/workflow for the patterns (proposed, draft, final)
- adopt the template for pattern description
- write a "howto create new patterns" guideline
- ....
